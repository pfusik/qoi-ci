This project implements encoding and decoding
the ["Quite OK Image" (QOI)](https://github.com/phoboslab/qoi) format
in the [Ć programming language](https://github.com/pfusik/cito).
Ć can be automatically translated to pure C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript,
Python and Swift with no additional dependencies.

This is work in progress!
